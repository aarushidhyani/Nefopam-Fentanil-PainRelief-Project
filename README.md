# Nefopam-Fentanil-PainRelief-Project
## Background of the study:
### Subject and method:

- 70 patients were randomly assigned to fentanyl 10µg/ml (Group F, n = 35) or fentanyl 10μg/ml with nefopam 1,2mg/ml with (Group NF, n = 35) using intravenous PCA.
- When postoperative VAS ≥ 4, titration in 48 hours with a background of continuous infusion rate of 0.25µg/kg/h
- bolus dose amount set at 0.5ml
- lockout interval set at 15 minute
- maximum dose amount 15ml/4 hours.

### Result:
- Both groups were similar for demographic characteristic, surgery, and anesthesia
- Pain scores(VAS) at rest were similar at the time of each examination and under 3.5
- VAS at exercise was higher in Group FN compared with Group F on the second day of PCA (p<0.05)
- Cumulative postoperative fentanyl consumptions at postoperative 48 hours was less than 15.2% in Group FN (631.7 ± 51.5µg) - -compared with Group F (744.6 ± 84.2µg) with p<0.05 on the second day of PCA (p<0.05)
- The A/D ratio in both groups was > 70%, higher in group FN compared with Group F at 24 hours with p<0.05.
- The average number of patients requiring bolus dose in the FN group (11.4 ± 7.6) was less than in the Group F (20.8 ± 11.0) with p<0.05.
- The percentage of satisfied patients was higher in group FN compared with Group F (77.1% and 62.9%, respectively, with p<0.05).

## Objectives for this assignment:
1. Compare the effects of pain relief drugs - Fentanyl and Nepofam
1.  Side-effect of Fentanyl and combined Fentanyl and Nepofam.
